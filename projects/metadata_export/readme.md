Databrary Metadata Export
=========================

This is an in process attempt at creating a [METS](http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/) metadata export/AIP profile. The purpose of which is to provide a full, machine readable metadata export for Databrary volumes. This is probably not the path towards a human readable metadata export for Databrary users and data contributors.

### Current Status

 - Basic volume and asset level relationships are being reflected
 - Technical Metadata for assets is limited and could be developed further
 - Relationship of metadata (related to participants and study features, not basic file or volume metadata) to assets and volumes is tentative/theoretical. Currently the question is what level of granularity makes sense for this information
 
### Next Steps

 - Need to determine the real-world use cases for this type of asset/collection description
 - Use case: Description of collections (studies) for other systems to understand what are contained in Databrary
 - Use case: Preservation of study structure for longer term access
 - Use case: Full data export for collection/study owners describing the entirety of their contribution (for portabilit?)

Overview of Certifications, Audits, and metadata standards for Data Repositories
================================================

#Certifications and Audits

##Data Seal of Approval (DSA)
- Overview: A peer reviewed certification for datasets that meet a certain number of requirements set out in the DSA guidelines. It is meant to demonstrate to researchers that data repositories are taking appropriate measures to ensure the long-term availability and quality of data they hold. The seal is awarded after an online self-assessment regarding a data repository's adherence to the guidelines. The assessment is then reviewed by the DSA Board before the seal is given. As oF late 2016, the DSA guidelines will be [updated and merged](http://datasealofapproval.org/en/news-and-events/news/2016/4/20/transition-new-guidelines/) with the ICSU World Data System (WDS)

##Trusted Repositories Audit and Certification (TRAC)
- Overview: Has its roots in a joint task force created to develop criteria enabling the identification of digital repositories capable of reliably storing, migrating, and providing access to digital collections. TRAC provides tools for the audit, assessment, and potential certification of digital repositories, establishes the documentation requirements required for audit, delineates a process for certification, and establishes appropriate methodologies for determining the soundness and sustainability of digital repositories.

##Digital Repository Audit Method Based on Risk Assessment (DRAMBORA)
- Overview: A self-assessment toolkit for auditing a repository in terms of risk management.

##ICSU World Data System (WDS)
- Overview: Developed out of the International Council for Science to ensure trustworthiness and quality of data. As of late 2016, the ICSU World Data System criteria will be merged with the Data Seal of Approval as per [this announcement](http://datasealofapproval.org/en/news-and-events/news/2016/4/20/transition-new-guidelines/).

#Metadata Initiatives

##Data Documentation Initiative (DDI)
- Overview: International standard in XML for metadata describing social science data. More of a agreed metadata schema than a certification.
- [Guidelines](http://www.ddialliance.org/resources/publications/working/BestPractices/DataLifeCycle)

##ISLE Meta Data Initiative (IMDI)
- Overview: Linguistics based metadata schema to describe multi-media and multi-modal language resources.

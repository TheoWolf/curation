Karen's lab: 
What data are collected at the end of the session and where do they go?

- Only thing that happens immediately is the video and.

- Videos:
	- 2.5 GB & 1.5 GB, 4 GB per session
	- Eventually synced together before coding
	- Uploaded to central server immediately, with subject id and camera annotation (handcam)
- Put body measurements and locomotor experience dates (milestones) into Datavyu, by creating new Datavyu file
- Release level into Databrary spreadsheet, demographics
- After videos are synced, we add the name of the new synced file to the Databrary spreadsheet.
- Some studies do databrary spreadsheet and datavyu file at the end of each week.

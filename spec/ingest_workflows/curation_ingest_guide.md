Bringing Your Data into Databrary: A guide for contributors
===========================================================

This guide outlines processes and outcomes that data contributors can expect before, during, and after they have added their data to Databrary. This guide is primarily for contributors who wish to add a dataset that has already been collected. For an overview of whether your data is eligible for sharing on Databrary see our section on [grandfathering already collected data](http://databrary.org/access/guide/investigators/release/grandfathering-data.html)

## <a name="expectations">Outlining expectations</a>

**What is Databrary and what are our goals?**

As Databrary is a library of shareable, video-based research data, our mission is to make your data accessible and reusable for the community of researchers, faculty, and students in the Behavioral Sciences. At the same time, we provide granular settings for respecting local IRB restrictions and the privacy of subjects involved in your research data (see: [Authorizing and managing affiliates](http://databrary.org/access/guide/investigators/authorization/affiliates.html) for further details). 


**How will data be accessed?**

You will have control over who has access to the datasets you put on Databrary. You can limit access on an individual, case-by-case basis, only with other Databrary site members, or with the public in general. 

The greatest value in contributing datasets to a shared repository is allowing others to access your data. Your data does not have to be public, but it must be shared in some way with a selection of authorized Databrary members in order to be in Databrary. For further details, see [Databrary release levels](http://databrary.org/access/guide/investigators/release/release-levels.html) and [Sharing data](http://databrary.org/access/guide/investigators/access.html)  

**How will data be stored?**

Databrary aims to include datasets from a large number of research contexts and accomodate a variety of different research products, datasets, and related documents. In that way, we can ensure that researchers, no matter what their field of study, can contribute data to Databrary. Thus enhancing the value of the repository to other members. For that reason, we will have to make an assessment of what variables from your study can be represented in your dataset's metadata on Databrary (which you will be able to edit, add to, and export after your data has been included). Not all reasearch variables will be able to be represented. Though in most cases, we can store metadata contained in various file formats for future access and preservation.

**Can users download my data (video files and metadata)?**

In the spirit of sharing and data reuse, all datasets can be downloaded by those who have been granted access to them. This should not be a deterant to sharing (but why??)


## <a name="initial_request">Initial request</a>

  After an initial request to have your data added to Databrary, Databrary staff and/or Principal Investigators will contact you to get further details about the nature of your dataset. 

  Depending on the nature of your dataset, we may ask for a representative sample of your data and metadata so we can get a better idea of how it might fit into Databrary. From there, we can discuss the stragegy for bring in your data in further detail.

  Upon drafting a plan for including your data, we will set up a process by which you can transfer your data to us.


  Questions you can expect about your data are:

  * What is the primary subject or participant in your data?
  * What access restrictions would you like to ensure on the dataset?
  * How many video files does your dataset contain?
  * What is the average length of videos in your dataset?
  * Are you able to split your data into sessions (i.e. documentation of experiments or lab trials on a specific date)?
  * How have you stored metadata to this point and how can we gain access to it?

  


## <a name="priority">Assessing priority and data preparedness</a>
  Priority and preparedness will be used to determine the approximate estimate for when a dataset will be fully ingested and available in Databrary. 

  **Priority**

  As a video-centric library for the behavioral sciences, we work to prioritize and highlight those datasets first.  

  **Preparedness**
  
  Incomplete datasets or datasets organized using non-standard methodologies may require more time to ingest or might not be ready at the moment for ingestion.

  In addition, time to bring in new datasets will depend on:

  * The rate at which the contributor is able to make their data available to Databrary. 
  * The condition of the data, and whether any remediation is needed to make it ready for Databrary. 
  * Whether it is all in digital form or needs to be digitized. This applies to data (e.g. video data that is only in analog formats) and metadata (e.g. intake forms that have important participant information, but is only on handwritten forms).
  * Whether the available metadata can be brought in via and automated process or not.


## <a name="after">After your data has been added to Databrary</a>
  Once the dataset is properly ingested and on the site, we will notify you so we can schedule a virtual tour via video conference (or in person should you be in the New York area). At this time we will show you around your data as it is represented in Databrary. At this point, we can address any questions about configuring the access settings or otherwise and give you an opportunity to make feedback and suggesstions for changes before we share the data to the Databrary community.

Questions for Dan:

1. Dataset name
For example: "Facial expressions in 6-month old infants and their parents in the still face paradigm"

2. Description, please see other studies on Databrary for appropriate style and length of descriptions. These are dataset descriptions (information about the procedures and what happened in the session, not about the analysis).

For example: 
"Six-month-old infants and their parents were video-recorded in the Face-to-Face/Still-Face (FFSF) procedure (Adamson & Frick, 2003). Infants sat in a carseat and their parents sat across from them. Parents and infants engaged in 3 minutes of natural positive interaction, then 2 minutes of "Still-Face" in which parents did not respond to infants, and then 3 minutes of renewed natural positive interaction." 

3. Camera view of parents? We can also store/upload these even if they can't be shared.

Will get us the videos of the parents

4. Rename conditions to something accessible to other users? (Currently: "Face-to-face", "Still face", "Reunion" -- seem as transparent as anything we have, no?)

Change still face to still-face

5. Other contributors, investigators?

6. Any other data or additional files that goes with this dataset or associated studies? (E.g. Automated facial image analysis or joystick data?).

7. Photo (or still-frame) for study profile photo

8. Any excerpts (photos or videos)? And publicly accessible or only to authorized users?

9. Study sample? 6 participants in Databrary, 12 mentioned in papers
- Are there more participants that can't be shared? We can still upload/store them.

10. Just out of curiosity, why did he only send the 6 kids? 

PI/General Questions:

1. Who would you want to give access to this particular dataset?
2. Who would you want to give access to all of Databrary's shared data?
3. Any lab members that could be beta testers and get paid?
4. As an advisor, what's your feeling about the appropriate level of access to allow PIs to grant so that we discourage PIs from giving out their password, but to also take responsibility for the people they are allowing to have access to Databrary?
5. What other datasets might he have on the horizon to contribute? You can contribute anything where even one person was asked about sharing.
6. Any excerpts from other studies he would share? 
	- All we'd need is the excerpt and the publication (pdf or link)
7. Data collection, we really want to understand what happens at the end, or maybe we should schedule another call to discuss this in more detail?
	- Who could we talk to in your lab? You and/or senior students?
8. Centralized or decentralized lab?
9. Autism Speaks/NIH Baby Sibling Research Consortium

jointly funded by Autism speaks - consortium that studies with high risk of autism, with different working groups. Jana Iverson, we should contact her. Alisha Halliday,

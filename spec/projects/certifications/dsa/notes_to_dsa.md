Questions That Pertain to Completing the Data Seal of Approval 
==============================================================

- Do we have a mission statement around preservation practices for assets deposited in Databrary (Under whose authority (government, funding body, chief executive etc.))
- Are Databrary contributors only restricted to uploading data that they own? How do we confirm/enforce this if so?
- Approach to studies with insufficient metadata for long term preservation
- Do we have, or what would it take to draft, a crisis management plan. Is this something that already takes place on the storage side? Should we have one otherwise?
- What about licenses -> end user agreements

Needed from Libraries and/or ITS
================================

####4 - The data repository has an explicit mission in the area of digital archiving and promulgates it.

4-1: Is there a Mission Statement which references digital preservation and archiving? Under whose authority (government, funding body, chief executive etc.) is the statement released?

4-2: Is succession planning in place for your digital assets? If so, please describe the plan and reference if possible.

4-3: How is the mission statement implemented?

####6 - The data repository applies documented processes and procedures for managing data storage. 

6-3: Are data recovery provisions in place? What are they?

6-4: Are risk management techniques used to inform the strategy?

6-5: What checks are in place to ensure consistency across archival copies.

6-6: What levels of security are required and how are these supported?

6-7: How is deterioration of storage media handled and monitored?

####11 - The data repository ensures the integrity of the digital objects and the metadata. 

11-2: How is the integrity of data and metadata monitored?

####12 - The data repository ensures the authenticity of the digital objects and the metadata

12-2: Does the repository maintain provenance data and related audit trails?

####Generally

- Help in defining AIPs, maybe DIPs
- Asset storage metadata details
  - Schema
  - How much detail, file level detail or should we/do we already provide?
  - Considering pushing the metadata to Ichabod?
- Harvesting
  - Implementing an OAI-PMH compatible layer or equivalent (does good API not count?)
